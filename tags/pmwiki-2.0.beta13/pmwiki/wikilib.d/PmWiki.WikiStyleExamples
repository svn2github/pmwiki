text=PmWiki continues to use WikiStyles as a mechanism for styling text with color and other attributes.  However, PmWiki 2.0 introduces the ability to control the styling further and to even place styles on blocks.께The basics of WikiStyles are the same as before--essentially a  style is specified within a pair of %-signs and styles the text that follows, as in:께(:markup:) [=쾆his text is %color=red% red, %color=blue% blue, %% and normal (black).=]께There are a wide number of available style properties, borrowed primarily from HTML and CSS.  In addition, an author can define a style "shortcut" by using the [@define=@] property.  For example, to define a style of [@%red%@], one can use:께(:markup:) [=%color=red define=mystyle%콷ere is some %mystyle% red text created using a style shortcut.=]께Shortcuts can be combined with other styles, including other shortcuts:께(:markup:) [=%color=red define=lovelyred%%bgcolor=yellow define=likegrapefruit%께%red% This text is red, %red bgcolor=#ccc% red on a grey background, and %lovelyred likegrapefruit% red on a yellow background.  =]께So far, this is all basically the same as what was available in PmWiki 1.0.  PmWiki 2.0 includes the capability to style blocks, by using the [@apply=@] style property.  Specifying [@apply=block@] in a `WikiStyle will cause that style to be applied to the entire block, instead of just the text that follows:께(:markup:) [=쾆his entire block %apply=block bgcolor=yellow% has a yellow background, even though the `WikiStyle appears in the middle of the line.  %bgcolor=pink% Other inline (non-block) WikiStyles can appear in the middle of the line,%% as before.=]께This means it's now possible to do right-aligned and centered text:께(:markup:) [=%block text-align=right% The text of this paragraph is right-aligned. 께%block text-align=center% The text of this paragraph is centered.  =]께콹n fact, PmWiki predefines [@%right%@] and [@%center%@] style shortcuts so that you can do this more simply:께(:markup:) [=%right% This is right-aligned.께%center% This is centered.=]께Authors can define their own custom styles:께(:markup:) [=%block bgcolor=#fdf define=Pm%%center bgcolor=#dfd border='3px dotted green' define=goofy%%right bgcolor=#ffffcc border='1px dotted red' define=rediguana%께%Pm% Any text that is on a light purple background is a comment from [[~Pm]].께%goofy% Here's some text from Goofy.께%rediguana% bla bla by rediguana!=]께Styles can be applied to almost any kind of block:께(:markup:) [=* %block bgcolor=yellow% Here is a list item* Here's another list item께* Here's more of a list께# A new list=]께In particular, this means that outlines are now possible using the predefined [@%ROMAN%@], [@%roman%@], [@%ALPHA%@], and [@%alpha%@] list-block styles.  The style has to be specified on the first item in the list (and we may develop an alternate syntax for this sort of ordered list):께(:markup:) [=# %ROMAN% Top level## %ALPHA% second-level## second-level## second-level### third-level### third-level## second-level### third-level#### %alpha% fourth-level##### %roman% fifth-level##### fifth-level#### fourth-level# top-level# top-level=]께WikiStyles can be combined with CSS stylesheets to do this automatically -- see Cookbook:OutlineLists.께----께What about marking up an entire block of pre-formatted text?  For instance, say I have the following :께ip access-list extended example-acl remark ** This is an example acl ** deny ip any host 10.0.0.1 permit ip any any께I'd like to mark the above in a green box with a border.  I know I need to use [= %block bgcolor=#dfd border='1px solid black' padding=5px =] for the box, but how do I apply it to the entire block?  If I place [= \\ =] at the end of each line, I lose the indent at the beginning of the line...께%purple font-style:italic% Use [@[=...=]@] to preserve the newlines in the block, as below (note the space at the beginning of the line containing the wikistyle): [= %block bgcolor=#dfd border='1px solid black' padding=5px% =][=[=쾖p access-list extended example-acl remark ** This is an example acl ** deny ip any host 10.0.0.1 permit ip any any =]=]께This results in께 %block bgcolor=#dfd border='1px solid black' padding=5px% [=쾖p access-list extended example-acl remark ** This is an example acl ** deny ip any host 10.0.0.1 permit ip any any =]께Awesome, thanks!  I think that's the only combination I didn't try!께%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
