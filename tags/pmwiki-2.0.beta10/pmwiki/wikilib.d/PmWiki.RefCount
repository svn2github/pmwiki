text=RefCount performs link reference counts on pages in the PmWiki database (i.e., counts of links between pages).께To use refcount add [@?action=refcount@] to the URL of any wiki page to bring up the reference count form. For example:께%newwin%http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/RefCount?action=refcount께The refcount form contains the following controls:*'''Show''' ~ This selects which pages will appear in the output**all ~ Shows all references **missing ~ Shows only references to pages that don't exist**existing ~ Shows only references to pages do exist**orphaned ~ Shows pages that exist but don't have any references to them.  There is no way to browse to an orphaned page.*'''page names in group''' ~ Selects which group(s) to the referenced pages can be in*'''referenced from pages in''' ~ Selects which group(s) the referencing pages can be in*'''Display referencing pages''' ~ Includes a link to the referencing page -- this can make for a very long output unless you limit the groups searched께The output is a table where each row of the table contains a page name or link reference, the number of (non-RecentChanges) pages that contain links to the page and the number of RecentChanges pages with links to the page.께This script can be activated by placing the following line in your ''local/config.php'' file.께[@include_once("scripts/refcount.php");@]께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
