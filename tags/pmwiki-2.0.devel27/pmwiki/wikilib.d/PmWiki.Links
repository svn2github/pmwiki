text=A key feature of [[WikiWikiWeb]]s is the ease of creating links to other places in the text of the document.  PmWiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links.께!!!Links to other pages께First, to create a link to another page, simply enclose the name of the page inside double brackets, as in [@[[wiki sandbox]]@] or [@[[installation]]@].  These result in links to pages called [[WikiSandbox]] and [[Installation]], respectively.께Inside the double brackets PmWiki will automatically capitalize words following spaces and other punctuation, thus [@[[Wiki sandbox]]@], [@[[wiki sandbox]]@], and [@[[WikiSandbox]]@] all display differently but link to the same page.께A suffix can also be added to the end of a link, which becomes part of the link text but not the target.  Thus [@[[wiki sandbox]]es@] is still a link to WikiSandbox but displays as [[wiki sandbox]]es.  And you can put parentheses around any text you don't want to have displayed, so that [@[[(wiki) sandbox]]@] still links to WikiSandbox but displays as [[(wiki) sandbox]].께Finally, you can specify the link text via a vertical brace, thus  [@[[WikiSandbox |a play area]]@], which links to WikiSandbox but displays as [[WikiSandbox |a play area]].  Alternately, you can use an arrow ([@->@]) to reverse the order of the text and target, as in [@[[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]@]  ([[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]).께Some sites also recognize WikiWord links, in which a WikiWord appearing in the text is automatically treated as a link to a page of the same name.께!!!Links to external sites ([=URLs=])께Links to external sites simply begin with a prefix such as 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.  Thus [@http://www.google.com/@] and [@[[http://www.google.com/]]@] both link to Google.  As with the above, an author can specify the link text by using the vertical brace or arrow syntax, as in [@[[http://www.google.com/ | Google]]@] and [@[[Google -> http://www.google.com]]@].께InterMap links are also supported (see [[InterMap]]).께!!!Links to certain passages (anchors) in the same page / in another page께To define a link-target (anchor, like HTML [@<a name='...'>@]) within a page, use the markup [@[[#anchor]]@]. 께To create a link to that target* within the same page use [@[[#anchor | text]]@]* to another page use either [@PageName#anchor@] or [@[[PageName#anchor | link text]]@]. 께%trail%<<|DocumentationIndex|>>
