This directory contains the files to display pages in PmWiki according
to the default "responsive" layout, adaptive for large and small screens.

Note that currently this layout is "experimental". It requires 
relatively recent mobile and desktop browsers (post-2010).

==>Don't edit these files directly, as you may lose your edits the
next time you upgrade PmWiki!

Instead, copy the files to another directory in pub/skins/ and edit
them there.  You can then configure PmWiki to use your modified layout
files by setting the $Skin variable in your local/config.php.  For 
example, if you copy your custom skin to pub/skins/custom, then you 
would set
   $Skin = 'custom';
in local/config.php.

The files in this directory:
    skin.tmpl   -- the default template for page layouts
    skin.css    -- PmWiki's default css
    skin.php    -- some template functions
    *.svg       -- icons

Note, the default PmWiki logo is in the "pmwiki" template directory.
If you just want to change the logo, you can do it by setting $PageLogoUrl
to the url location of your logo.
