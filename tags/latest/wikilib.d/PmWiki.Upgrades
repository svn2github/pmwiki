text=(:Summary:How to upgrade an existing PmWiki installation:)%0a[[PmWiki]] is designed to make it easy to upgrade the PmWiki software without affecting your existing data files or installation.  For most upgrades, you simply copy the files in the new release over your existing installation.%0a%0a%25block bgcolor=#f7f7f7 color=black border='1px solid black' padding=5px%25 '''Note for PmWiki 1.0 sites:''' Upgrading from 1.0.x to 2.0 requires more than simply copying the 2.0 software over the 1.0 installation.  See [[(PmWiki:)Upgrading From PmWiki 1]] for more details.%0a%0a>>lframe smaller%3c%3c%0aContents%0a* [[#gen|Generic instructions]]%0a* [[#v21v22|Upgrading from version 2.1.27 to 2.2.0]]%0a* [[#v220|Upgrading from version 2.2.0 to the latest version]]%0a* [[#faq|FAQ]]%0a>>%3c%3c[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a[[#gen]]%0a!! Generic instructions %0a%0a!!! 1. Read the release notes%0aPlease read carefully the [[(PmWiki:)ReleaseNotes]] before performing an upgrade, about the changes between your previous version and the new one. See if there are any significant changes or preparation tasks that must be handled before performing the upgrade.%0a%0a!!! 2. Backup%0aIt's ''always'' a good idea to have a [[(PmWiki:)backup( and Restore)]] copy of your existing PmWiki installation before starting.  You can copy the entire directory containing your existing installation, or you can just make copies of the ''wiki.d/'' directory and any other local customization files you may have created (e.g., ''config.php'', ''localmap.txt'', etc.).%0a%0a!!! 3. Download and extract%0aDownload the version of PmWiki that you want from the [[(PmWiki:)download]] page.%0a%0aExtract the tar image using @@tar -xvzf ''tgzfile''@@, where ''tgzfile'' is the tar file you downloaded above.  This will create a @@pmwiki-x.y.z@@ directory with the new version of the software.%0a%0a!!! 4. Copy%0aCopy the files in @@pmwiki-x.y.z@@ over the files of your existing PmWiki installation.  For example, if your existing PmWiki installation is in a directory called ''pmwiki'', then one way to copy the new files over the existing ones is to enter the command:%0a%0a->@@cp -a pmwiki-x.y.z/. pmwiki@@%0a%0aNote that BSD systems will not have the -a option as a command-line argument for ''cp'', but that's okay, since it's just shorthand for ''cp -dpR'', so use that instead of ''-a''.%0a%0aSome environments have an alias established for ''cp'' that enable interactive prompts before overwriting a file. To work around this specify the absolute path to ''cp'', such as ''/bin/cp''.%0a%0aOn (some) [=FreeBSD=] servers and Mac OS X systems you need to use %0a%0a->@@cp -Rpv pmwiki-x.y.z/. pmwiki@@%0a%0a!!! 5. Update customisations and recipes%0aThat's it! Your base PmWiki installation is complete.%0a%0aNow use the [[PmWiki:Site Analyzer]] to determine which recipes could be updated to the most recent version.%0a%0aUnless you have made customizations to the ''pmwiki.php'' script or to the files in ''scripts/'', your PmWiki installation should continue to run correctly! (Changes to these files are {+not+} recommended).%0a%0a([[Local customizations]] should go in ''local/config.php'', ''pub/css'', and ''pub/skins/''yourskinname)%0a%0a'''Note''': Additional tips can be found on the [[PmWiki:Troubleshooting]] page.%0a%0a%0a[[#v21v22]]%0a!! Upgrading from version 2.1.27 to 2.2.0%0a%0aBetween the stable versions 2.1.27 and 2.2.0 there are a number of additions. Some of them may need changes to local config files or to wiki pages, and they are outlined here. For the full list of changes see [[ReleaseNotes#v220|the release notes]].%0a%0aIf you are upgrading from a 2.2.beta version, your wiki may already include these features.%0a%0a* Some pages that were formerly in the [[Site]].* group are now in a separate read-protected [[SiteAdmin]].* group: Site.AuthUser, Site.AuthList, Site.NotifyList, Site.Blocklist, and Site.ApprovedUrls.  If upgrading from an earlier version, PmWiki will prompt to automatically copy these pages to their new location if needed.  If a site wishes to continue using the old Site.* group for these pages, simply set to config.php @@$SiteAdminGroup = $SiteGroup;@@%0a%0a* To authorize reading or editing in protected areas, the former password @@"nopass"@@ should now be written as @@"@nopass"@@.%0a%0a* [[WikiWords]] are now disabled by default.  To re-enable them, set either $LinkWikiWords or $EnableWikiWords to 1.%0a%0a* The $ROSPatterns variable has changed -- replacement strings are no longer passed through FmtPageName() i.e., it must now be done explicitly.%0a%0a* [[Links|Page links]] inside included pages, sidebars, headers or footers are now treated as relative to the page where they are written, instead of the page where they appear. For example, in Site.SideBar, always set the group in a wikilink like [@[[Main/HomePage]]@] or with a page variable [@[[{*$Group}/HomePage]]@], because a link [@[[HomePage]]@] will point to a page Site.HomePage.%0a%0a* [[PageLists]]%0a** Spaces no longer separate wildcard patterns -- use commas. %0a** [@{$PageCount}, {$GroupCount}, {$GroupPageCount}@] variables used in pagelist templates are now [@{$$PageCount}, {$$GroupCount}, {$$GroupPageCount}@].%0a** The directive no longer accepts parameters from urls by default.  In order to have it accept such parameters (which was the default in 2.1 and earlier), add a [@request=1@] option to the [@(:pagelist:)@] directive.%0a%0a* [[Skin templates]] are now required to have %3c!--HTMLHeader--> and %3c!--HTMLFooter--> directives.  %0a%0a* Authentication using Active Directory is now simplified, see [[PmWiki.AuthUser]].%0a%0a%0a[[#v220]]%0a!! Upgrading from version 2.2.0 to the latest version%0a%25commentout-pmwikiorg%25 ''Note: this page may have a more recent version, see PmWiki:Upgrades.''%0a%0aSome additions since version 2.2.0 may need changes to local config files or to wiki pages, and they are outlined here. For the full list of changes see [[ReleaseNotes|release notes]] and [[change log]].%0a%0a* Version 2.2.10: $EnableRelativePageVars was changed to enabled by default, and it affects [[PageVariables]] from included pages, sidebars, headers and footers.%0a** The form [@{*$var}@] refers to "the currently browsed page" while [@{$var}@] without an asterisk refers to "the physical page where the PageVar is written".%0a** %25red%25 Pages that are designed to work on "the currently browsed page" should switch to using [@{*$FullName}@] instead of [@{$FullName}@]. %25%25 Administrators should especially check any customized versions of [[Site.PageActions]], [[Site.EditForm]], [[Site.PageNotFound]], SideBar pages, $GroupHeaderFmt, $GroupFooterFmt, [[Page lists]] in sidebars, headers, and footers. See [[Page variables#specialreferences|Special references]].%0a** If your wiki heavily relies on the previous behavior, you can revert to it, see $EnableRelativePageVars.%0a%0a* Version 2.2.35: Important change for international wikis: the XLPage() function no longer loads encoding scripts such as xlpage-utf-8.php. When you upgrade, you need to include those scripts from config.php, before the call to XLPage(): [@%0a  include_once("scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php"); # if your wiki uses UTF-8%0a  XLPage('bg','PmWikiBg.XLPage');%0a@]%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a!! FAQ%0a%0aQ: How can I determine what version of PmWiki I'm running now?%0aA: See [[version]] - {Version$:Summary}.%0a%0aQ: How can I test a new version of PmWiki on my wiki without changing the prior version used by visitors?%0aA: The easy way to do this is to install the new version in a separate%0adirectory, and for the new version set (in local/config.php):%0a[@%0a%0a    $WikiLibDirs = array(&$WikiDir,%0a      new PageStore('/path/to/existing/wiki.d/{$FullName}'),%0a      new PageStore('wikilib.d/{$FullName}'));%0a%0a@]%0aThis lets you test the new version using existing page content%0awithout impacting the existing site or risking modification of%0athe pages.  (Of course, any recipes or local customizations have to%0abe installed in the new version as well.) %0a%0aThen, once you're comfortable that the new version seems to work%0aas well as the old, it's safe to upgrade the old version (and one%0aknows of any configuration or page changes that need to be made).%0a
