text=PmWiki has the capability of classifying pages into groups of related pages.  [[WikiWord]]s form links between pages of the same group; to create a link to a wiki page in another group, you use @@[=GroupName.WikiWord=]@@ or @@[=GroupName/WikiWord=]@@ to create the link.께By default, the RecentChanges page of each group shows only the pages that have changed within that group; the Main.AllRecentChanges page shows all pages that have changed in all groups.께Creating a new group is as easy as [[CreatingNewPages]]; simply edit an existing page to include a link to a page in the new group, then click on the '?' to edit the page. 께Each group can also have [=GroupHeader=] or [=GroupFooter=] pages that contain text to be automatically prepended or appended to every page in the group.  A group can also have a GroupAttributes page that defines attributes (read and edit passwords) shared by all pages within the group.  Each page can also have its own individual read/edit password that overrides the group passwords (see [[PmWiki.Passwords]]).께Finally, [[WikiAdministrator]]s can set [[LocalCustomizations]] on a per-group basis--see [[PerGroupCustomizations]].께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
