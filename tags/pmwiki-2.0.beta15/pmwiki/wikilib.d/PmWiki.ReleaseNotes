text=!!!Version 2.0.beta15 (10-Jan-2005)²²The major feature of this release is the addition of the graphical buttons in the edit page.  By default this feature is disabled -- to enable it, use the following in config.php.²²    $EnableGUIButtons = 1;²²The rss.php script has also been improved -- it now automatically translates named character entities (from HTML 4) into their numeric equivalents.  This eliminates a lot of feed validation errors and problems in specific RSS feed consumers.²²This release adds a $Titlespaced variable and [@{$Titlespaced}@] markup; $Titlespaced is replaced by either a page's title (if defined by the [@(:title:)@] directive) or by the spaced version of the page's name.²²Finally, a number of WikiStyles bugs have been fixed.²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta14 (28-Dec-2004)²²This release introduces a number of relatively minor optimizations and improvements, summarized below.  If you don't understand what any of these mean, they probably don't affect you.  :-) ²²* PmWiki's <img ...> tags now use style='border:0px;' instead of border='0'.²²* `PrintFmt() now calls Lock(0) to release any locks prior to sending output to the browser.  This is important because some webservers (notably Apache) sometimes get stuck when they're unable to send output to the browser, and thus inadvertently lock others from being able to edit/post pages.²²* $PageEditFmt now includes id='text' to make for easier styling/referencing.²²* `MarkupToHTML()'s "posteval" code has been changed considerably.²²* `PageExists() now caches results of checking for page existence.²²* Page urls are now automatically url-encoded as needed.²²* Many of PmWiki's internal regex patterns have been optimized to (hopefully) improve matching speed.²²* Comparisons to substr() have been replaced with more efficient comparison functions.²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta13 (22-Dec-2004)²²This release fixes a bug introduced in 2.0.beta7 that prevented the refcount.php (for ?action=refcount) from generating links correctly.  It also cleans up the handling of wikistyles and %-in-urls (which is what 2.0.beta7 was supposed to fix).²²In general, all sites using the 2.0.betaXX series are recommended to upgrade to this latest release.²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta12 (21-Dec-2004)²²This release adds a number of <div> tags and identifiers around the²various forms that PmWiki produces (e.g., uploads, search results,²attribute pages, etc.).  This makes such forms easier to style in CSS.²²In addition, this release adds some functionality to the urlapprove.php²script to limit the number of unapproved urls that can be saved in²a page (helps to combat wikispam).²²Finally the release adds the [@(:description:)@] markup for generating <meta name='description' ... /> tags in the output.  [@(:description:)@] may also get used for other features later on (e.g., excerpts in search results, etc.).²²!!!Version 2.0.beta11 (19-Dec-2004)²²This release primarily cleans up a number of items in the handling of uploads:²# A new $LinkUpload variable has been defined for $...Fmt strings -- it contains the URL of the upload page for the current attachment²# [@(:attachlist:)@] automatically adds "replace-attachment" links (denoted by triangles) to the items in the list²# After performing an upload, the "upload name" field is automatically cleared²# Fixed error message when upload exceeds maximum allowed by PHP²²This release also changes the `StopWatch() function (used internally for benchmarking/timing PmWiki performance) to only have an effect when $EnableStopWatch is set to 1 (wall clock timings only) or 2 (wall clock and user-process timings).²²!!!Version 2.0.beta10 (14-Dec-2004)²²This release makes some substantial improvements in the installation²procedure.  First, the installation steps have been simplified, and PmWiki²provides accurate instructions when it encounters a PHP "safe_mode"²environment.  ²²The release also provides better handling of the '.flock' file -- if²PmWiki discovers it cannot open an existing .flock file for writing,²it removes the file and tries again rather than complaining about it.²This makes the system more robust when page directories are going²through backup+restore.²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta9 (14-Dec-2004)²²This release provides some very minor bugfixes to the [@[[target |#]]@] markup, to the appearance of $...variables in documentation, and extends uploads.php to be able to work better with url rewriting.²²!!!Version 2.0.beta8  (13-Dec-2004)²²This release makes a number of reasonably significant changes.  First and²foremost, it changes the [@?pagename=@] uri syntax to be [@?n=@], and²installation now defaults to $EnablePathInfo = 0; to make better²compatibility.²²Sites which wish to continue using the [@.../Main/HomePage@] form of uri²instead of [@?n=Main.HomePage@] should set $EnablePathInfo = 1 in²config.php.  ²²This release also fixes a probable bug in the handling of author²names which was causing spaces to be incorrectly removed.²²2.0.beta8 includes features for advanced CSS styling of [[simple tables]]²via the $TableRowAttrFmt and $TableCellAttrFmt variables, more description ²will be forthcoming in a Cookbook recipe.  ²²Also, this release includes vastly improved support for UTF-8 sites,²including the ability to have UTF-8 characters in pagenames and²[@[[utf-8 links]]@].  We're still working out the details to be²able to support UTF-8 wikiwords -- PHP's functions don't provide²good support for this.  See scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php for more²information on UTF-8.²²Finally, the Q: and A: markups are back, and a few other minor²bug fixes and documentation improvements have been included.²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta7  (8-Dec-2004)²²This release has a number of improvements and changes to it.  First,²this release provides a ''scripts/xlpage-utf-8.php'' file, which adapts²PmWiki to be able to work somewhat with utf-8 characters in pagenames.²Since PHP's preg_* functions seem to be unable to detect UTF-8 alphanumeric²characters, the trade-off at the moment is that WikiWord links are limited²to the ASCII character set.  We're working on ways to get around this²restriction, however.²²The xlpage-utf-8.php script can be automatically loaded by any `XLPage ²translation that specifies 'xlpage-i18n' => 'utf-8'.²²This release also:²²* fixes up the .htaccess files that are placed in local/ and wiki.d/²* changes the default textarea size for the pmwiki skin, ²* restores the link/citation markup ([@[[target |#]]@])²* fixes the default value of $DefaultPageTextFmt (note this may change again)²* automatically converts instances of $Newline in posted text²²²!!!Version 2.0.beta6  (5-Dec-2004)²²This release contains a number of relatively minor bugfixes (see the ChangeLog), and it also restores the $WikiWordCount functionality from PmWiki 1 in which the wiki administrator can limit the number of conversions for each WikiWord.²²The ''sample-config.php'' file has been updated with more comments and suggestions for customizations.²²Finally, this release increases the default value of $MaxIncludes to 50 (and provides better documentation of the $MaxIncludes variable).²²!!!Version 2.0.beta5  (1-Dec-2004)²!!!Version 2.0.beta4  (1-Dec-2004)²²These releases fix a number of bugs introduced by the changes in 2.0.beta3.²Users of 2.0.beta3 are encouraged to upgrade directly to this release.²²!!!Version 2.0.beta3  (30-Nov-2004)²²This release provides a simple version of the [@(:attachlist:)@] markup (different sorting orders are not available yet as the syntax is likely to change), as well as fixes the PmWiki.EditQuickReference and PmWiki.UploadQuickReference pages.  It also provides default pages to lock passwords in the Main and PmWiki groups and adds uppercase versions for ".GIF", ".JPG", and ".PNG" files.²²Internally, this release also changes the edit page sequence to use the $_POST autoglobal instead of $_REQUEST (i.e., posting edits is only allowed via method='post' and not via query string parameters).²²!!!Version 2.0.beta2²²This release fixes the bug that caused $PageTemplateFmt to no longer²work in pmwiki-2.0.beta1.²²!!!Version 2.0.beta1²²This release marks PmWiki 2.0 as entering "beta" status, as it finally²begins moving towards official release.  The major change for this release²is in the skins code -- previous versions of PmWiki used $PageTemplateFmt²to specify the location of the template file to be used; newer versions²now use the $Skin variable to specify the location of the skins directory²(in pub/skins/) that contains the skin template file, php configuration²script, and other files.²²In general, if you previously had $PageTemplateFmt set to "pub/skins/myskin/myskin.tmpl", then you now simply set $Skin='myskin'; to get things to work.  See PmWiki.LayoutBasics for more details.²²!!!Version 2.0.devel releases²²These are the release notes for the development releases of PmWiki 2.0.²²First, this is definitely still in the development stages, so many²things are likely to change between now and the official releases.²²Second, at present there's not a good way to upgrade from PmWiki 1.0²to PmWiki 2.0, although upgrade support is expected to arrive in future²(development) releases.  So, you can use this version just to see the²new developments and gain some experience, but migrating from 1.0²to this version is still likely to be a bit of a chore.²²Bugs and other requests can be reported to the PmWiki Issue Tracking ²System at http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PITS/PITS.  Any help²in testing, development, and/or documentation is greatly appreciated.²
